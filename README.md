For this hackathon, our team quickly chose to make a game! A game inspired by Pokemon, Clash Royale, and Insryption! After brain storming for only a littlewhile we quickly agreead upon doing an auto battler story game! Firstly, the player will go through a little story that would explain to them about the card game before being hit by BAM! Gameplay of actual battles! This game is called Interdimenitional Card battle while we have 2 teams of Idols that battle each other to become the best!

Before we talk about more, please have a look at our [designs and plans for this game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aYsDeFC6W7r5yPrY4QzcpaH5Zy9belcDm06WAZT2hcQ/edit?usp=sharing)!!

Starting off we first made a lovely little concept art of what we believed the battling area would be now. Later on we met up more than weekly to talk about the project and plan, actually, since all of us had some kind of artistic background we could easily communicate with each other in the relation fields and could bounce from one and other incase we needed any help when it came to art.

A few sneek peeks at our concept arts are below!

We used a couple Libraries, from UnityLib to BlackBoard and even *almost* Ink! And the Language we used for programming was C# (CSharp).
